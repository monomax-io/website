I am available for hire as a contractor. Here are some of the things I can achieve for your company:

* **Solve complex problems in production.** At <a href="https://dnote.io" target="_blank">Dnote</a>, a big design challenge was to sync users' notes across many machines each running offline-first clients. I wrote <a href="https://dnote.io/blog/state-based-sync/" target="_blank">a scalable state-based replication algorithm</a> to reliably sync note states across distributed machines.
* **Write complex fullstack applications for production.** I have built and shipped <a href="https://sung.io/about/" target="_blank">numerous commercial applications</a> using Go, React, JavaScript, and node.js.
* **Optimize your frontend performance.** At <a href="https://luxuryescapes.com" target="_blank">Luxury Escapes</a>, the checkout page built with React was slow to render and respond. I sped up the page render by 40% and responsiveness by 35% by carefully benchmarking the app and writing a state machine. You can learn more [in this case study](/case-study/luxuryescapes).
* **Rewrite legacy code.** I have replatformed a number of enormous legacy applications running PHP or .NET into node.js microservices and React frontend. You can read more <a href="https://techblog.luxgroup.com/cutting-your-losses-c895612dd27c">in this article.</a>
* **Rapidly and reliably build new features and products.** Let's make. I shipped commercial applications such as <a href="https://dnote.io" target="_blank">Dnote</a> and <a href="https://sung.io/lessons-from-successfully-launching-remotebase/" target="_blank">RemoteBase</a>, used by thousands of people.
* **Evangelize products among technical communities.** At <a href="https://dgraph.io" target="_blank">Dgraph</a>, I built applications using the product, <a href="https://sungwoncho.github.io/presentations/" target="_blank">gave talks</a> and <a href="https://blog.dgraph.io/post/building-graphoverflow/" target="_blank">wrote articles</a>, spreading the technology and help growing the fledgling community.
* **More things.** Software is my passion and I strive to achieve a higher mastery and deliver greater impact. I can bring the same attitude to your company.

I have extensive experience with a number of technologies in production, notably JavaScript, Go, React and Ruby. Here is my <a href="https://github.com/sungwoncho" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>, a <a href="/resume.pdf">resume</a>, and <a href="https://sungwoncho.github.io/presentations/" target="_blank">talks with links to videos.</a>
